GmodPillPack
============

This is the base Pill Pack addon. It allows you to change into creatures and machines from Half Life 2.

You must have it installed to use the other packs.

Download the current "stable" version from the Steam Workshop. This is the "bleeding edge" development version.

Feel free to contribute to this or make your own packs. Please model custom packs after the Episodic and Team Fortress packs.
